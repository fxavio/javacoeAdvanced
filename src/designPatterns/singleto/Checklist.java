        //Hands-on:Hands-on Design Patterns
        //1. *Singleton Pattern*
        //Scenario: You're building a configuration manager for your application. You need a single, centralized instance that holds all configuration settings and provides access to them throughout the application.
        //Problem: Creating multiple instances of the configuration manager would lead to inconsistent or conflicting configuration values.
        //Solution:The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance, providing a global access point for configuration settings throughout the application.
        //Real-World Examples:
        //1. Logging frameworks like Log4j or SLF4j often use the Singleton pattern to ensure a single logger instance for centralized logging.
        //2. Configuration managers in various applications ensure consistent configuration values across all parts of the system.
        //Takeaways:
        //1. The Singleton pattern guarantees a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
        //2. This is useful for configurations, loggers, or resource managers where you only need one instance throughout your application.
        //3. Be cautious with Singletons as overuse can make code less testable and harder to maintain. Use them judiciously for truly global, shared state.

        //Challenge: Implement a simple DatabaseConnection class using the Singleton pattern. This class can manage opening and closing a connection to the database.
        //Solution Approach:
        //1. Create a DatabaseConnection class with a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation.
        //2. Implement a static getInstance() method that checks if an instance exists. If not, it creates a new instance and returns it.
        //3. Add methods for opening and closing the database connection (consider using a connection pool in real-world scenarios).
