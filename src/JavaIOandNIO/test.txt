Java NIO is commonly used in networking applications where high concurrency and performance are required, such as web servers, messaging systems, and streaming applications. It offers more flexibility and efficiency compared to traditional blocking I/O, especially in scenarios with a large number of connections or high data throughput requirements.
NIO is also commonly used in distributed systems and cloud computing environments, where efficient network communication is essential for scalability and performance.
Overall, Java NIO is a powerful and versatile tool for building high-performance networking applications in Java.
